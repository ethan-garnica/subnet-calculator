# **Subnet Calculator**
### **Description**
This is a simple python program that runs in command line. It will ask the user to input an IP address along with the number of bits in the submask (i.e., 192.168.24.10/24). The program will then take the user input and print out the subnet mask, first host, last host, broadcast address, number of usable hosts, if the input is a valid host, and the subnet class.

### **How to use**
All that is needed to use the program is the python file.
